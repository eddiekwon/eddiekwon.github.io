어느날 평소와 다름 없이 pod install을 했는데 갑자기 원치않는 에러를 또 만나게 되었다. 아니 이건 또 뭐람.

```bash
git:(release/develop) $ pod install
Analyzing dependencies
[!] CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "XXXCrashAgent":
  In Podfile:
    IMQACrashAgent (~> 1.3.0)

None of your spec sources contain a spec satisfying the dependency: `XXXCrashAgent (~> 1.3.0)`.

You have either:
 * out-of-date source repos which you can update with `pod repo update` or with `pod install --repo-update`.
 * mistyped the name or version.
 * not added the source repo that hosts the Podspec to your Podfile.

Note: as of CocoaPods 1.0, `pod repo update` does not happen on `pod install` by default.
```

해결: 싱겁게 끝났다.

```bash
$ pod repo update
```
